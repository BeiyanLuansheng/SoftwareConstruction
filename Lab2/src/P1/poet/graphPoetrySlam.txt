If the day is done,
if birds sing no more,
if the wind has flagged tired,
then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me,
even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep
 and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk.
From the traveller,
whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended,
whose garment is torn and dustladen, whose strength is exhausted,
remove shame and poverty,
and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night.

I know that the day will come when my sight of this earth shall be lost,
and life will take its leave in silence, 
drawing the last curtain over my eyes.
Yet stars will watch at night, 
and morning rise as before, 
and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains.
When I think of this end of my moments,
the barrier of the moments breaks and I see by the light of death thy world with its careless treasures.
Rare is its lowliest seat, 
rare is its meanest of lives.
Things that I longed for in vain and things that I got---let them pass.
 Let me but truly possess the things that I ever spurned and overlooked.
